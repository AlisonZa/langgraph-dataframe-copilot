# Project Structured Data Agentic AI 🤖

## Overview:
The project aims to build a reliable LangGraph agent that helps non-data scientists with simple tasks. 🌟

### Features
The agent uses a Python REPL that can run code related to activities such as:
* Data Visualization 📊
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍

### Explored Concepts
* Human-in-the-loop feedback 👥
* LangGraph graphs, nodes, and routers 🌐
* Prompt engineering 📝
* Structured outputs 📋

### Technologies Used:
* **LangChain** as the AI Orchestrator 🔗
* **LangGraph** Agentic AI Framework 🧠
* **ChatGroq** as LLM Client 💬
* **llama3-groq-70b-8192-tool-use-preview** LLM 🦙
* **Pandas** for data manipulation 📈
* **Matplotlib** for data visualization 🖼️

## Getting Started:
(Provide instructions on how to set up and use the project here.)

## Future Improvements:
* Provide the analyst with prompts for any errors that occur. Currently, the user must pass them manually. ⚠️
* Add new data structures to enhance functionality. 🚀
